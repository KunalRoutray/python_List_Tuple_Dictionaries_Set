##Q 01 Write a Python program to create a list of integers of size N and store random values in
it. Find and display the sum and average. Create two more lists that contain the even
and odd values from this list.

##Q 02 Write a Python program using a list that reads the integers between 1 and 100 and counts
the occurrences of each. Assume the input ends with 0.
Here is a sample run of the program:
Enter the integers between 1 and 100: 2 5 6 5 4 3 23 43 2 0
2 occurs 2 times
3 occurs 1 time
4 occurs 1 time
5 occurs 2 times
6 occurs 1 time
23 occurs 1 time
43 occurs 1 time
Note that if a number occurs more than one time, the plural word
“times” is used in the output.

##Q 03 Write a function that finds the smallest element in a list of double values. Write a Python
program that prompts the user to enter ten numbers, invokes this function to return the
minimum value, and displays the minimum value.
Here is a sample run of the program:
Enter ten numbers: 1.9 2.5 3.7 2 1.5 6 3 4 5 2
The minimum number is: 1.5

##Q 04 Define a function that eliminates the duplicate values in the list. Write a Python program
that reads in ten integers, invokes the method, and displays the result.
Here is the sample run of the program:
Enter ten numbers: 1 2 3 2 1 6 3 4 5 2
The distinct numbers are: 1 2 3 6 4 5

##Q 05 Define a function that returns the sum of all the elements in a specified column in a
matrix. Write a Python program that reads a 3-by-4 matrix and displays the sum of each
column.
Here is a sample run:
Enter a 3-by-4 matrix row by row:
1.5 2 3 4
5.5 6 7 8
9.5 1 3 1
Sum of the elements at column 0 is 16.5
Sum of the elements at column 1 is 9.0
Sum of the elements at column 2 is 13.0
Sum of the elements at column 3 is 13.0

##Q 06 Define a function to add two matrices. In order to be added, the two matrices must have
the same dimensions and the same or compatible types of elements. Let c be the resulting
matrix. Each element 𝑐௜௝ is 𝑎௜௝ + 𝑏௜௝. For example, for two 3 * 3 matrices 𝑎 and 𝑏, 𝑐 is
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter two 3 * 3 matrices and displays
their sum.

##Q 07 Define a function to multiply two matrices.
For example, for two 3 * 3 matrices 𝑎 and 𝑏, 𝑐 is
where 𝑐௜௝ = 𝑎௜ଵ ∗ 𝑏ଵ௝ + 𝑎௜ଶ ∗ 𝑏ଶ௝ + 𝑎௜ଷ ∗ 𝑏ଷ௝. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter two 3 * 3 matrices and displays
their product.

##Q 08 Write a Python program that randomly fills in 0s and 1s into a 4-by-4 matrix, prints the
matrix, and finds the first row and column with the most 1s.
Here is a sample run of the program:
0 0 1 1
0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0
The largest row index: 2
The largest column index: 2

##Q 09 You are supposed to remove duplicate entries from a list. The constraint is that the
original order should be preserved. Write function remove_duplicates(values). Q 10 Given two lists of numbers, each sorted in ascending order, merge them into a result list
according to their order. Write function mergeList(values1, values2)

##Q 11 Write function is_magic_triangle(values) that checks whether a sequence of numbers
forms a magic triangle. Such a triangle is defined as one where the respective sums of the
three sides’ values must all be equal. The sequence of numbers must be entered in the
form of a list.
Here is a sample run:
>>> is_magic6([1, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6])
True
>>> is_magic6([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
False

##Q 12 Create a tuple containing the names of five countries and display the whole tuple. Askthe user to enter one of the countries that have been shown to them and then display
the index number (i.e. position in the list) of that item in the tuple.

##Q 13 Add to program in Q 12 to ask the user to enter a number and display the country in
that position.

##Q 14 Write a program that prints up to nth Fibonacci number by using a dictionary.

##Q 15 Write a program that prints a histogram of frequencies of characters occurring in a
message supplied by the user.
